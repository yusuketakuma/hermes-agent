# Brain Operations — The Ambient Context Layer

Recall relevant context before responding. Save explicit requests with
provenance; automatic capture is off until the user opts in. Reading this skill
does not enable capture, delegation, or paid enrichment. A chat-only instruction
suppresses writes for that turn, including when standing capture is enabled.

> **Convention:** See `skills/conventions/brain-first.md` for the 5-step lookup protocol.
> **Convention:** See `skills/conventions/quality.md` for citation and back-link rules.

> **Memory verbs (MEMORY_VERBS v1, gbrain ≥ 0.43).** Over MCP, prefer the five
> core memory verbs for the read/write cycle: **`remember(fact, provenance,
> ttl?)`** to save a single durable fact (mandatory provenance; dedupes +
> supersedes), **`recall(query | entity, budget_tokens)`** to read it back
> budget-packed, **`entity(name)`** for a zero-LLM card, **`synthesize(question)`**
> for the expensive cross-page answer, **`forget(id)`** to withdraw active memory
> (history, source material, and backups may remain). `context_pack` and `delta`
> complete the seven-verb surface. Use
> `remember` instead of `extract_facts` when you already have ONE formed fact;
> `put_page` / `add_link` / `add_timeline_entry` stay the page/graph write path.
> Fall back to the classic ops when the verbs aren't on the surface. Contract:
> `docs/protocol/MEMORY_VERBS_v1.md`.
>
> **Keyless brains:** when `extract_facts` returns `skipped:
> extraction_unavailable`, YOU are the extractor — pull the facts from the turn
> yourself and write each one via `remember` with `kind` set (event | preference
> | commitment | belief | fact — those five are the frozen protocol enum; the
> `idea` kind the extractor and DB carry is NOT one of them) and the
> visibility the envelope's `agent_action` names
> (default private — pin it; `remember` defaults to world), or author a
> `## Facts` fence on the entity page. A `skipped: extraction_failed` envelope
> (server-side extractor errored on this turn; `reason` names why) invites the
> same manual `remember` fallback for that turn — automatic extraction stays
> on for future writes.

## Contract

This skill guarantees:
- Brain is checked BEFORE any external API call (brain-first lookup)
- Explicit save requests and opted-in inbound signals trigger the READ → WRITE
  loop; enrichment requires its separately configured authority
- Every outbound response checks brain for relevant context
- Source attribution on every fact written (inline `[Source: ...]` citations)
- User's direct statements are highest-authority data
- Back-links maintained on every brain write (Iron Law)

## Iron Law: Back-Linking (MANDATORY)

Every mention of a person or company with a brain page MUST create a back-link
FROM that entity's page TO the page mentioning them. An unlinked mention is a
broken brain. See `skills/conventions/quality.md` for format.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Brain-First Lookup (MANDATORY)

Before using ANY external API to research a person, company, or topic:

1. `gbrain entity "<name>"` (v0.43+) — ONE known person/company/project → full card (description, aliases, open threads, recent events, edges, backlink/fact counts). Zero LLM calls, sub-100ms. This one call replaces steps 2–6 for known-entity lookups; near-misses return suggestions.
2. `gbrain search "name"` — exact-token lookup for existing pages (cheap hybrid, no expansion)
3. `gbrain query "natural question about name"` — concept/landscape questions go here FIRST (expansion recovers synonym phrasings; a nonzero `search` count is not proof of completeness)
4. `gbrain get <slug>` — if you know the slug, read the full page
5. Check backlinks: who references this entity?
6. Check timeline: recent events involving this entity

The brain almost always has something. External APIs fill gaps, not start from scratch.

**⚠️ NEVER scope/count a corpus with shallow `ls` — query gbrain or `find`.** Federated sources often carry MULTIPLE coexisting directory conventions — a flat legacy layer AND a date-nested `meetings/YYYY/MM/` layer. A non-recursive `ls dir/*.md` sees only one and undercounts massively. Real example: a shallow `ls` of one source's `meetings/` counted 132 files, almost all the user's, and concluded that WAS the corpus — missing thousands of transcripts nested under `meetings/YYYY/MM/`. To count/scope a brain corpus:
  - **Best:** `gbrain sources list` (shows per-source indexed page counts) + `gbrain query`. gbrain indexes ALL federated sources correctly; trust its index, not the filesystem.
  - **If you must hit the FS:** `find <dir> -name '*.md' | wc -l`, never `ls *.md`. Then map the layout: `find <dir> -name '*.md' | sed -E 's#(.*/)[^/]+$#\1#' | sort | uniq -c`.
  - The bug is never "gbrain can't see the source" — it's almost always a shallow FS glob. Verify against `gbrain sources list` before believing a low count.

### Phase 1.5: Analytical Queries (gbrain think)

For questions that need synthesis, temporal grounding, or analytical answers —
not just "find the page" but "answer the question":

1. Use `gbrain think "<question>"` — multi-hop synthesis across pages + takes +
   the graph. Temporal questions route through trajectory analysis; everything
   else gets an LLM-synthesized, cited answer with conflict + gap analysis.
   Returns a grounded answer, not just a list of matching pages.
2. Best for: "when did acme-example last raise", "what was the ARR in March",
   "what changed since Q1", "who is alice-example's cofounder and what are they
   working on", "summarize our relationship with acme-example".
3. Falls back gracefully to standard retrieval when no timeline facts match.
4. Cost: LLM calls per question — this is the expensive path. Use `query` for
   simple page lookups where you just need the slug or a quick context check.

### Phase 2: Authorized Capture (READ → WRITE)

For an explicit save request, or a message within the user's opted-in capture
scope that has no chat-only restriction:

1. **Detect entities** — people, companies, deals mentioned
2. **Load brain pages** — read existing pages for context before responding
3. **Identify new information** — what does this signal tell us that the page doesn't know?
4. **Write it back** — update the brain page with new info + timeline entry + source citation
5. **Create if missing** — if notable, save supplied information with provenance;
   invoke enrichment only when separately authorized

Attribute the user's direct statements with `[Source: User, YYYY-MM-DD]`.
Without capture authorization, use the information in the current conversation
without persisting it. Explicit remembering does not enable ongoing capture.

### Phase 2.5: Structured Graph Updates (auto-link)

"Auto-link" reconciliation extracts entity references from a page and writes
them to the graph (`links` table) with inferred relationship types; stale
links (refs no longer in the page text) are removed. WHO runs it depends on
the write path:

- **Trusted local writes** (`gbrain put`, `gbrain capture`,
  `gbrain call put_page`) auto-link inline and return
  `auto_links: { created, removed, errors }`.
- **MCP callers (stdio AND HTTP)** return `auto_links: { skipped: "remote", hint }`
  and `auto_timeline: { skipped: "remote" }`. Body wikilinks are saved as text.
  A stdio `gbrain serve` reconciles the edges asynchronously with its
  maintenance sweep (startup + 10-minute idle ticks).
  `gbrain serve --http` does not self-sweep — reconcile on demand with
  `gbrain sweep --once` (delegates to the live serve over IPC) or
  `gbrain extract links --source db`.
  Use `add_link` for relationships you need immediately. Untrusted body text can plant
  ranking-boosting edges, which is why the inline path is local-only.
- Inferred link types: `attended` (meeting -> person), `works_at`, `invested_in`,
  `founded`, `advises`, `source` (frontmatter), `mentions` (default).
- To disable: `gbrain config set auto_link false`. Default is on.
- Timeline entries with specific dates still need explicit `gbrain timeline-add`
  (or batch via `gbrain extract timeline --source db`).

### Phase 3: On Every Outbound Response (READ → PULL → RESPOND)

Before answering any question about a person, company, or topic:

1. **Check the brain** — read relevant pages
2. **Pull context** — use compiled truth + recent timeline
3. **Respond with context** — the brain makes every answer better

Don't answer from general knowledge when a brain page exists.

### Phase 4: Optional Enrichment

Enrichment is an additional user choice. Neither a mentioned entity, a shared
link, nor capture opt-in authorizes external research, paid calls, or delegation
by itself. Follow an explicit ingestion/enrichment request or the user's stored
scope and spending policy. Without that authority, recall existing context and
save only the supplied information that the user authorized retaining.

Use background agents only when delegation is authorized and supported by the
harness. Report observed results without claiming a generated routine ran.

## Output Format

Use retrieved context in the response and cite it. Confirm authorized writes
only after readback; if no write was requested or opted in, do not persist the
conversation merely to produce a memory update.

## Cross-source citation format (v0.18.0+)

When a brain has multiple sources (wiki, gstack, yc-media, etc.), every
citation MUST include the source id: `[source-id:slug]`. Example:

> You told me about the retry budget approach — see
> [wiki:topics/resilience] and [gstack:plans/retry-policy] for where
> this came from.

Rules:
- The key is `sources.id` (immutable), never `sources.name` (mutable display).
- Single-source brains still write `[default:slug]` OR may omit the prefix
  for backward compat.
- Every page payload returned by `search`, `query`, `get_page`, `list_pages`
  carries `source_id` — always use it when citing, never guess.

If a search result has `source_id: "gstack"` and `slug: "plans/foo"`,
the citation is `[gstack:plans/foo]`. That's the whole rule.

## Anti-Patterns

- Answering questions about people/companies without checking the brain first
- Using external APIs before checking the brain
- Writing facts without inline `[Source: ...]` citations
- Blocking the response to do enrichment
- Overwriting user's direct statements with lower-authority sources
- Creating brain pages for non-notable entities
- Creating duplicate pages for the same entity — always check first before creating: `gbrain entity "<name>"` (catches aliases + near-misses), then `query` with name variants

## Tools Used

- `search` — cheap hybrid search (vector + keyword, no expansion)
- `query` — hybrid search + LLM multi-query expansion (concept/landscape questions)
- `get_page` — read a brain page
- `put_page` — create/update brain pages
- `add_link` — cross-reference entities
- `add_timeline_entry` — record events
- `get_backlinks` — check who references an entity
- `sync_brain` — sync changes to the index
