# Cold Start — Day-One Brain Bootstrapping

You have a working brain. Search works. Now what?

An empty brain is a static database. A brain with your email history, calendar,
contacts, conversations, and social media is a **live context membrane** that makes
every future interaction smarter. This skill sequences the highest-leverage data
sources to get you from zero to useful in one session.

## Contract

- Every import phase is gated on user consent (ask-user pattern) before proceeding.
- **The agent never holds raw OAuth tokens or API keys.** This is a safety
  requirement, not a preference. Three paths satisfy it for Google data:
  the native connector (`gbrain google setup` — tokens live in gbrain's
  credential vault, mode 0600, never in the agent's context; see
  `docs/guides/google-connect.md` and `skills/google-loops/SKILL.md`),
  ClawVisor (a hosted credential gateway that vaults credentials,
  enforces task-scoped authorization, logs every API call, and requires
  human approval for destructive operations — needs a harness with the
  integration), or offline file exports (Google Takeout, Twitter archive
  download).
- Each phase is independently valuable — the user can stop after any phase and still
  have a useful brain.
- Progress is tracked in `~/.gbrain/cold-start-state.json` so interrupted sessions
  can resume.
- Entity detection and cross-linking run on every import, not as a separate pass.

## Prerequisites

- GBrain installed and initialized (`gbrain doctor --json` all green)
- Brain repo cloned and synced
- Agent has terminal access and can run `gbrain` CLI commands

## The Priority Stack

Data sources ranked by **information density × ease of import**:

| Priority | Source | Why | Time | Pages Created |
|----------|--------|-----|------|---------------|
| 1 | Existing markdown/Obsidian | Highest density — it's already structured | 5 min | 100s-1000s |
| 2 | Google Contacts | Seeds the people/ directory — names, emails, companies | 10 min | 50-500 |
| 3 | Google Calendar (90 days) | Meeting history with attendee context | 15 min | 30-90 |
| 4 | Gmail (recent threads) | Relationship context, active threads, org chart signals | 20 min | 50-200 |
| 5 | Conversations (ChatGPT/Claude exports) | Your thinking, questions, mental models | 15 min | 10-100 |
| 6 | X/Twitter archive | Your public positions, takes, engagement patterns | 20 min | 30-365 |
| 7 | File archives (Dropbox/Drive/local) | Historical documents, old writing, photos | 30+ min | varies |
| 8 | Meeting transcripts (Circleback/etc.) | Deep relationship context from recorded calls | 20 min | 10-50 |

## Phase 0: ClawVisor Setup (only if your agent harness integrates ClawVisor)

**Harness check first.** ClawVisor requires an agent host with a ClawVisor
integration (for example, an OpenClaw deployment). On harnesses without one,
such as Codex or Claude Code, skip this phase: the default for Contacts,
Calendar, and Gmail is the native connector — `gbrain google setup` (live
sync; tokens in gbrain's local credential vault, never with the agent; see
`skills/google-loops/SKILL.md`) — with a
[Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com) export as the offline
alternative covering all three (contacts CSV, calendar ICS, Gmail mbox).
Phases 2-4 below document the Takeout path first.

> **Safety boundary:** An AI agent with raw OAuth tokens to your Gmail, Calendar,
> and Contacts is an uncontrolled attack surface. One prompt injection, one
> malicious tool call, and your entire Google account is exposed. ClawVisor
> eliminates this risk class entirely.

[ClawVisor](https://clawvisor.com) is a credential gateway that sits between the
agent and your APIs. The agent never sees your credentials — ClawVisor injects
them at request time, enforces policies, and logs everything.

**What ClawVisor gives you:**
- **Credential vaulting** — agent sees shadow tokens, never real secrets
- **Task-scoped authorization** — each workflow declares exactly what it needs
- **Audit trail** — every API call logged with metadata (who, what, when)
- **Human approval gates** — destructive operations (send email, modify calendar)
  require your explicit approval
- **Multi-service** — Gmail, Calendar, Contacts, Drive, GitHub, iMessage from one gateway
- **Revocation** — disable the agent's access in one click, no token rotation needed

**Setup (15 min):**
1. Sign up at [app.clawvisor.com](https://app.clawvisor.com)
2. Create an agent in the dashboard, copy the agent token
3. Set environment variables (in the host agent's environment — shell profile
   or harness config; gbrain itself has no ClawVisor config keys, these are
   consumed by the host's ClawVisor integration. This requires an agent host
   with a ClawVisor integration, such as an OpenClaw deployment. Codex and
   Claude Code do not consume these variables; use the offline import path
   instead):
   ```bash
   export CLAWVISOR_URL="https://app.clawvisor.com"
   export CLAWVISOR_AGENT_TOKEN="<token>"
   ```
4. Activate Google services (Gmail, Calendar, Contacts) in the dashboard
5. Create a standing task with expansive scope:
   > "Full brain bootstrapping: read emails, calendar events, and contacts to
   > populate knowledge base. List, read, and search across all connected accounts."
6. Save the standing task ID the same way:
   ```bash
   export CLAWVISOR_TASK_ID="<task_id>"
   ```

**Critical scoping rule:** Be expansive in task purposes. "Email triage" gets
rejected by intent verification. "Full executive assistant email management
including inbox triage, searching by any criteria, reading emails, tracking
threads" works. The intent model uses the purpose to judge each request.

### If the user declines ClawVisor

Do NOT fall back to direct OAuth. Instead, proceed with offline-only imports:

- **Phases 2-4** (Contacts, Calendar, Gmail) — work from a Google Takeout export
- **Phase 1** (markdown/Obsidian) — works without any API access
- **Phase 5** (conversation exports) — works from downloaded JSON files
- **Phase 6** (X/Twitter) — works from downloaded archive
- **Phase 7** (file archives) — works from local files
- **Phase 8** (meeting transcripts) — works from exported transcripts

Tell the user:
> "No problem. Two options: the native connector (`gbrain google setup`) does
> live Gmail/Calendar/Contacts sync with your own OAuth app — tokens stay in
> gbrain's local credential vault, never with me — or a Google Takeout export
> covers all three as a point-in-time snapshot."

**Do NOT hold raw Google tokens yourself.** An agent holding tokens in its
context is a security liability. The native connector is the sanctioned
OAuth path precisely because gbrain vaults the tokens (0600 file, redacted
listings) and the agent only ever runs CLI commands; secrets travel by file
or env intake, never argv or chat. See `skills/google-loops/SKILL.md` for
the exact protocol.

## Phase 1: Existing Markdown / Obsidian Import

**The highest-leverage first import.** If the user already has a notes system, this
is hundreds or thousands of structured pages ready to go.

### Discovery

```bash
echo "=== Markdown Repository Discovery ==="
for dir in ~/git/* ~/Documents/* ~/notes/* ~/obsidian/*; do
  if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
    md_count=$(find "$dir" -name "*.md" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
      -not -path "*/.git/*" -not -path "*/.obsidian/*" 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
    if [ "$md_count" -gt 5 ]; then
      total_size=$(du -sh "$dir" 2>/dev/null | cut -f1)
      echo "  $dir ($total_size, $md_count .md files)"
    fi
  fi
done
```

### Import

```bash
# Obsidian vaults are markdown directories — import directly, then wire wikilinks
# (full flow: skills/migrate/SKILL.md)
gbrain import /path/to/vault --no-embed --workers 4
gbrain extract links --source db      # parses [[wikilinks]] natively

# For plain markdown directories
gbrain import /path/to/dir --no-embed --workers 4

# Verify
gbrain stats
gbrain search "<topic from the imported data>"
```

### Post-import

- Run link extraction: `gbrain extract links --source db`
- Run timeline extraction: `gbrain extract timeline --source db`
- Start embeddings: `gbrain embed --stale` (runs in background)

> **Track progress:**
> ```bash
> echo '{"phase_1_complete": true, "pages_imported": N}' > ~/.gbrain/cold-start-state.json
> ```

## Phase 2: Google Contacts → People Pages

**Seeds the people/ directory.** Every person in your contacts becomes a brain page
with name, email, phone, company, and notes. This is the foundation that all other
imports build on — when Gmail references "john@acme.com", the brain already knows
who John is.

### Via Google Takeout (default on harnesses without ClawVisor)

1. Export contacts from [takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com)
   (select Contacts, CSV format), or directly from
   [contacts.google.com](https://contacts.google.com) via Export → Google CSV.
2. Parse the CSV: each row carries name, email(s), phone(s), organization,
   and notes.
3. Run each row through the processing rules below to create people/ pages.

### Via ClawVisor (ClawVisor-integrated hosts only; pseudo-code)

```javascript
// Fetch all contacts
const contacts = await clawvisor('google.contacts', 'list_contacts', {
  limit: 1000,
  fields: 'names,emailAddresses,phoneNumbers,organizations,biographies'
});
```

### Processing rules

For each contact:
1. **Filter out noise** — skip contacts with no name, no email, or that are clearly
   automated (noreply@, no-reply@, support@, notifications@)
2. **Check brain first** — `gbrain search "name"` to avoid duplicates
3. **Create people/ page** with:
   - Name, email(s), phone(s), company, title
   - Source attribution: `[Source: Google Contacts, YYYY-MM-DD]`
   - Any notes from the contact as initial context
4. **Link to company** — if the contact has an organization, create/update the
   company page and link the person to it

### Quality gate

After importing 5 contacts, pause and show the user a sample page. Ask:
> "Here's what a contact page looks like. Want me to continue with the rest, or
> adjust the format first?"

## Phase 3: Google Calendar (Last 90 Days)

**Meeting history with attendee context.** Calendar events reveal who the user meets
with, how often, and in what context. Combined with contacts, this builds a rich
relationship map.

### Fetch events

**Via Google Takeout (default on harnesses without ClawVisor):** export
Calendar from [takeout.google.com](https://takeout.google.com) (ICS format,
one file per calendar). Parse each event (title, start/end, attendees), keep
the last 90 days, and file them into the brain structure below.

**Via ClawVisor (ClawVisor-integrated hosts only; pseudo-code):**

```javascript
// Via ClawVisor — query ALL calendar accounts
const accounts = ['primary@gmail.com', 'work@company.com'];
for (const account of accounts) {
  const events = await clawvisor(`google.calendar:${account}`, 'list_events', {
    timeMin: new Date(Date.now() - 90 * 86400000).toISOString(),
    timeMax: new Date().toISOString(),
    singleEvents: true,
    orderBy: 'startTime'
  });
}
```

### Brain structure

Follow the three-tier calendar architecture:
```
brain/daily/calendar/
├── calendar-log.md              ← compiled truth (patterns, key people)
├── YYYY/
│   ├── YYYY-MM.md               ← monthly summary
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD.md            ← daily event log
```

### Entity enrichment

For each event with attendees:
1. Look up each attendee in the brain (they should exist from Phase 2)
2. Add a timeline entry to their page: met at [event title] on [date]
3. If an attendee has no brain page and appears in 3+ events, create one
4. Link attendees who appear in the same meeting

## Phase 4: Gmail (Recent Threads)

**Relationship context and active threads.** Email reveals organizational
relationships, ongoing conversations, and communication patterns.

On harnesses without a ClawVisor integration, the source is the Gmail mbox
file from a [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com) export. The sampling
and filtering rules below apply the same way.

### Strategy: Smart sampling, not bulk import

Don't import every email. Import the **signal**:

1. **Sent mail (last 30 days)** — who the user actively communicates with
2. **Starred/important emails** — user-curated signal
3. **Threads with 3+ replies** — active conversations worth tracking
4. **Emails from people already in the brain** — enrichment, not cold import

### Processing

For each email thread:
1. **Entity detection** — extract people, companies mentioned
2. **Update people pages** — add communication context to timeline
3. **Create meeting pages** — if the email is a meeting summary or follow-up
4. **Skip noise** — newsletters, automated notifications, marketing

### Filtering rules

**Auto-skip (never import):**
- noreply@, no-reply@, notifications@, support@, mailer-daemon@
- Unsubscribe-heavy senders (marketing)
- GitHub/Jira/Linear notification emails
- Calendar invites (already captured in Phase 3)

**Always import:**
- Direct emails from people in the brain
- Starred/flagged emails
- Emails the user sent (their words are highest-value signal)

## Phase 5: Conversation Exports (ChatGPT / Claude / Perplexity)

**Your thinking, captured.** AI conversation exports reveal what the user
was researching, building, and thinking about. This is original thinking
preserved in dialog form.

### Supported formats

- **ChatGPT:** Settings → Data Controls → Export → `conversations.json`
- **Claude:** Download from claude.ai conversation history
- **Perplexity:** Export from settings

### Processing

For each conversation:
1. **Assess significance** (1-5 scale):
   - 1 = Pure utility (how-tos, quick lookups) → skip or minimal page
   - 2 = Minor context → 1-paragraph note
   - 3 = Notable (reveals interests, building something) → full page
   - 4 = Important (deep personal processing, strategic thinking) → rich page
   - 5 = Defining (identity work, breakthrough insights) → full treatment
2. **Extract entities** — people, companies, concepts discussed
3. **Capture original thinking** — the user's exact phrasing is the signal.
   Never paraphrase.
4. **File by primary subject** — not in a "conversations/" dump. A conversation
   about a person goes to people/, about a concept goes to concepts/, etc.

### Quality rule

Only import conversations rated 3+. The brain is for signal, not noise.

## Phase 6: X/Twitter Archive

**Your public positions and engagement patterns.** Twitter reveals what the user
thinks, who they engage with, and what ideas they're developing publicly.

### Data sources

1. **Twitter data export** (Settings → Your Account → Download Archive)
   - Contains all tweets, likes, DMs, bookmarks
2. **Live API** (if available) — recent tweets and engagement
3. **Bookmarks** — curated signal, high value

### Brain structure

```
brain/media/x/{handle}/
├── x-log.md                     ← compiled truth (themes, voice, key threads)
├── daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md          ← daily tweet log
├── monthly/YYYY-MM.md           ← monthly rollup
└── bookmarks/                   ← saved/bookmarked content
```

### Processing

- **Original tweets** → capture with full context, extract entities
- **Quote tweets** → capture the user's commentary + the source tweet
- **Threads** → reconstruct as a single narrative
- **Bookmarks** → high-signal curation, import with tags
- **Likes** — low signal, skip unless the user wants them

## Phase 7: File Archives

**Historical documents, old writing, photos with metadata.** This is the long tail —
less structured but potentially very high value (old journals, letters, early writing).

Delegate to the `archive-crawler` skill. It handles:
- Crawling directory structures
- Filtering for high-value content (user's own writing, not installers)
- Text extraction from PDFs, images (OCR), documents
- Entity extraction and brain page creation

> **Safety gate:** Archive crawling can be slow and create many pages.
> archive-crawler is a skill, not a CLI command — it refuses to run without an
> explicit `archive-crawler.scan_paths:` allow-list in `gbrain.yml`. Add the
> archive path to the allow-list, run the skill's scan pass first, and show the
> user the manifest before proceeding with full ingestion.

**Supported sources:**
- Local directories (Dropbox sync folder, Google Drive, old hard drives)
- Cloud storage (Backblaze B2, S3) via mounted paths
- Email archives (PST, mbox, EML, Google Takeout)
- Data exports (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.)

## Phase 8: Meeting Transcripts

**Deep relationship context from recorded calls.** If the user has a meeting
recording service (Circleback, Otter, Fireflies, Read.ai), import recent
transcripts.

Delegate to `meeting-ingestion` skill. Key rules:
- Always pull the **complete transcript**, not just the AI summary
- Entity propagation is MANDATORY — every attendee gets a timeline update
- A meeting is NOT fully ingested until all entity pages are updated

## Post-Bootstrap Checklist

After completing available phases:

1. **Verify brain health:**
   ```bash
   gbrain doctor --json
   gbrain stats
   ```

2. **Test retrieval:**
   ```bash
   gbrain query "who do I meet with most often?"
   gbrain query "what am I working on?"
   gbrain search "<person from contacts>"
   ```

3. **Set up live sync** (if not already):
   - Calendar: daily cron
   - Email: periodic sweep (4-8 hours)
   - X: daily ingest
   - Brain repo: `gbrain sync --repo <path>` every 5-30 minutes

4. **Track state:**
   ```json
   // ~/.gbrain/cold-start-state.json
   {
     "started": "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z",
     "credential_gateway": "clawvisor",
     "phases_completed": [1, 2, 3, 4],
     "phases_skipped": [6, 7],
     "total_pages_created": 847,
     "total_entities_linked": 1203,
     "next_phase": 5
   }
   ```

5. **Tell the user what to do next:**
   > "Your brain has N pages across people, calendar, email, and conversations.
   > Live sync is configured for [sources]. From here:
   > - The **signal-detector** captures entities from every conversation
   > - The **briefing** skill can compile daily context
   > - The **daily-task-prep** skill handles day planning
   > - Say 'enrich [person]' to deep-dive any contact"

## Anti-Patterns

- **Giving the agent raw OAuth tokens.** This is the #1 anti-pattern. An agent with
  raw Gmail/Calendar tokens is an uncontrolled attack surface — one prompt injection
  and your entire Google account is exposed. Use ClawVisor. If the user declines
  ClawVisor, skip to offline imports. Never offer direct OAuth as a fallback.
- **Bulk importing everything without filtering.** The brain is for signal, not noise.
  Filter out automated senders, marketing emails, utility conversations.
- **Importing without entity cross-linking.** Every import should detect entities and
  update existing brain pages. Isolated imports don't compound.
- **Not gating on user consent.** Every phase should be presented as a choice. The user
  may not want their DMs or therapy conversations imported.
- **Importing everything at significance 1.** Not every conversation is worth a brain
  page. Use the significance scale and skip utility content.
- **Creating people pages for automated senders.** Sentry, GitHub notifications,
  newsletter platforms are not people. Filter by the rules in Phase 4.

## Resume Protocol

If the session is interrupted:

1. Read `~/.gbrain/cold-start-state.json`
2. Skip completed phases
3. Resume from `next_phase`
4. The user doesn't have to repeat credential setup or re-import completed sources

## Output Format

After each phase:

```
PHASE N COMPLETE: [source name]
================================

Pages created: N
Pages updated: N
Entities linked: N
Time elapsed: N min

Sample pages:
- people/jane-smith.md (created — 3 emails, 5 meetings)
- companies/acme-corp.md (updated — 2 new employees linked)

Next: Phase N+1 — [description]. Ready to proceed?
```

## Tools Used

- `search` — check for existing pages before creating
- `query` — hybrid search for entity deduplication
- `get_page` — read existing pages for merge decisions
- `put_page` — create and update brain pages
- `add_link` — cross-reference entities
- `add_timeline_entry` — record events on entity timelines
- `sync_brain` — sync changes to the index after each phase
