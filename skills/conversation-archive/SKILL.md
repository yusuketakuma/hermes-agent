## What This Is

Two halves of one loop:

1. **IMPORT** — raw export or session log → dated markdown pages under
   `conversations/` (the native importer writes them directly and splits
   long sessions into parts; the manual path converts one page per
   conversation, then `gbrain import`/`gbrain sync`) → parser validation →
   fact extraction → gap check.
2. **RETRIEVE** — search the archive, pull threads, build timelines, and
   answer "when did I first discuss X".

Years of AI-assistant history is one of the largest personal corpora most
users own. This skill makes it first-class brain content instead of a JSON
blob in a downloads folder.

**A native importer now exists: `gbrain transcripts ingest`.** It parses
agent session logs (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes, Grok Build) AND
extracted consumer exports (ChatGPT `conversations.json`, Claude.ai export)
directly: detection, secret redaction, imessage-slack rendering,
long-session splitting, and idempotent re-runs are all native. Prefer it
over the manual procedure whenever the source is one of those seven
formats:

```
gbrain transcripts ingest ~/Downloads/conversations.json   # unzip first
gbrain transcripts ingest                                  # discover harness logs
gbrain transcripts ingest --max-bytes 4gb <store>          # oversized store (omit = per-format caps)
gbrain transcripts status                                  # found vs imported gaps
```

`--max-bytes` note: the cap is part of the `--since last` checkpoint
fingerprint — running with a different cap (or dropping it) starts a fresh
watermark scope, so a capped run's skipped tail is never mistaken for
already-scanned.

Native-vs-manual delta to know: the native lane redacts SECRETS by FORMAT
(vendor key prefixes, JWTs, cloud/API key shapes, `Bearer` headers,
connection strings carrying inline passwords, PEM private keys, and
high-entropy `KEY=`/`TOKEN=`/`PASSWORD=` assignments) plus your
`~/.gbrain/harvest-private-patterns.txt` regexes and counts agent-directed
imperatives into frontmatter, but broad PII detection (names, phones,
addresses) remains YOUR review pass — the manual procedure's human scrub step
still applies to sensitive corpora. Preview what will be scrubbed with
`--dry-run` before a bulk `--all`. If a secret still reached a page, rotate
it first, then remove the page immediately with
`gbrain delete <slug> --purge` (local CLI only — no 72h tombstone); the
brain-repo git history or a synced file may still hold it. Two more deltas: the
native lane caps each message at ~4K characters in the page body (readable
archive, not verbatim — the session file named in `source_uri` stays the
verbatim record), and tool/thinking traffic appears only as one-line
placeholders. Providers without a native adapter (e.g. Perplexity) keep
using the manual conversion below.

## Where Conversations Live

```
conversations/chatgpt/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md      — ChatGPT threads
conversations/claude/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md       — Claude threads
conversations/perplexity/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md   — Perplexity threads
conversations/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md     — agent session transcripts
```

One page per conversation. Date-prefixed slugs make origin tracing sortable
and feed the recency ranking; the frontmatter `date:` drives the page's
`effective_date` (used by `--since`/`--until` filters).

**Slug collisions are real — disambiguate deterministically.** Untitled threads
share a title ("New chat"), and several conversations can land on the same day,
so `YYYY-MM-DD-new-chat` collides across threads. `put_page` has no
compare-and-swap: a second write to a colliding slug overwrites the first
(silent loss). Suffix the slug with a short stable hash of the thread id or
export url (`YYYY-MM-DD-new-chat-a1b2c3`) so distinct threads never share a
slug, and check-before-write (`gbrain get <slug>`) — a hit that is NOT the same
thread means append the hash, not overwrite.

## Import Procedure

### Step 1 — Parse the export

- **ChatGPT:** Settings → Data controls → Export data → `conversations.json`.
  Each conversation stores messages as a tree in `mapping`; walk parent
  pointers from `current_node` to recover the linear thread.
- **Claude:** Settings → Privacy → Export data → `conversations.json` with a
  flat `chat_messages` array per conversation.
- **Perplexity:** no full-archive export; threads arrive one at a time
  (page save or paste). Same page format applies.

Provider formats drift between export versions — inspect the actual JSON
before writing the converter, don't trust a remembered schema.

### Step 1.5 — Redact secrets and PII (mandatory, pre-write)

Chat exports and session transcripts routinely contain pasted secrets and
personal data — an API key someone dropped into a prompt, an access token, a
private address. Scanning is NOT optional: run it on every conversation before
writing any `conversations/` page, because a written page is indexed, searched,
and (if the brain is ever shared or published) leaked.

Before writing each page, scan the transcript for secret-shaped strings and
PII, and redact each match to a labeled placeholder (`[REDACTED_API_KEY]`,
`[REDACTED_TOKEN]`, `[REDACTED_EMAIL]`):

- Vendor-prefixed keys (`sk-…`, `ghp_…`, `AKIA…`/`ASIA…`, `AIza…`,
  `sk_live_…`, `glpat-…`, `npm_…`, `hf_…`), format-only credentials with NO
  prefix (JWTs `eyJ….eyJ….…`, account SIDs, connection strings with an inline
  password), bearer/authorization tokens, PEM private-key blocks, and
  `KEY=`/`TOKEN=`/`PASSWORD=` assignments whose value is high-entropy.
- Personal data the transcript wasn't meant to publish: phone numbers, home
  addresses, government ids, private emails.

The model is gbrain's own `~/.gbrain` deny-list / `runPrivacyLint` pattern
(`src/core/skillpack/harvest-lint.ts`): a fixed set of secret-shaped patterns
matched deterministically, redacted before the content is committed. Redaction
changes the transcript, so note it in the import receipt (`Redacted: N secrets
/ M PII spans`) — this is the one sanctioned edit to an otherwise-verbatim
transcript, and "verbatim" never means "ship a live credential."

### Step 2 — Convert: one markdown page per conversation

```markdown
---
title: Agent memory architectures
type: conversation
date: 2025-03-15
source: chatgpt
url: https://chatgpt.com/c/<thread-id>
message_count: 24
tags: [conversation, chatgpt]
---

**You:** How should long-term agent memory be structured?

**ChatGPT:** There are three broad approaches...
```

Rules that make the page machine-readable, not just human-readable:

- `type: conversation` is REQUIRED — it is what makes the page eligible for
  `gbrain extract-conversation-facts`.
- Message lines use `**Speaker:** text` (parses via the built-in
  `bold-name-no-time` pattern, date taken from frontmatter). When the export
  carries per-message timestamps, prefer
  `**Speaker** (YYYY-MM-DD H:MM AM): text` (the `imessage-slack` pattern,
  inline dates). Run `gbrain conversation-parser list-builtins` to see every
  supported line shape.
- Transcript text is verbatim. The user's exact words are the signal —
  no paraphrase, no cleanup, no summarization in the transcript body.
- Person/company-shaped names inside YOUR examples and reports stay generic
  (`alice-example`, `acme-example`); the imported transcript itself is the
  user's private content and stays exact.

### Step 3 — Trial before bulk

Convert 3-5 conversations, run Steps 4-5 on them, read the pages, THEN run
the full archive. For a multi-thousand-thread export, track the run with the
[bulk-ingestion](../bulk-ingestion/SKILL.md) manifest so a crash resumes from
ground truth.

### Step 4 — Import

- Pages written inside the brain repo: `gbrain sync --no-pull`
- Standalone conversion directory: `gbrain import <dir> --source-id <id>`

**Write-path == commit-path (invariant 3, below):** the directory the
converter writes and the directory the import/commit covers MUST be derived
from the same constant. Never let a wrapper script `git add` or import a
path the converter doesn't actually write to — that failure is silent and
permanent.

### Step 5 — Validate via the conversation-parser surface

```bash
gbrain conversation-parser scan conversations/chatgpt/2025-03-15-agent-memory
```

Reports which pattern matched and the parsed message count. A `no_match` on a
transcript page means the converter emitted a line shape the parser can't
read — fix the converter and regenerate, don't hand-patch individual pages.

### Step 6 — Extract facts (native flow)

```bash
# Preview: segmentation + counts, no DB writes
gbrain extract-conversation-facts --types conversation --dry-run --limit 5

# Real run, cost-capped; use --background for large archives
gbrain extract-conversation-facts --types conversation --max-cost-usd 5
```

This is the shipped batch extractor (`gbrain extract-conversation-facts
--help` for workers, per-page `--slug`, resumability). Entity pages,
backlinks, and deeper enrichment route through the existing
[ingest](../ingest/SKILL.md) / [enrich](../enrich/SKILL.md) skills — do not
re-implement them here.

## Three Invariants (root-caused upstream — do not reintroduce)

An upstream deployment of this pipeline silently lost days of transcripts.
The root cause was three stacked bugs; the fixes are structural. Preserve
them in any archiver you build with this skill:

1. **Capture cadence must outrun store eviction.** Session stores rotate
   content out of their retained window. Content written early in a long
   session and evicted before the next archive tick is unrecoverable. Pick
   an archiving period strictly shorter than the source's retention window
   (for a store that evicts intra-day, every-6-hours beats daily). If content
   the user clearly said is missing, check eviction-vs-cadence first.
2. **No gap detection = silent holes.** A "yesterday only" archiver turns any
   missed run (machine down, job failure, restart) into a permanently missing
   day with no alert. Every run must compare source dates against archived
   pages over a trailing window and backfill the difference — every tick
   self-heals.
3. **Write-path == commit-path.** The single deadliest bug: a wrapper that
   committed a directory the converter never wrote to, making the scheduled
   archive a permanent no-op that only "worked" on manual runs. One constant
   defines the output directory; the writer and the commit/import step both
   read it.

## Gap-Healing Backfill Procedure

Run this after any import, and periodically for ongoing capture:

1. **Enumerate the source:** conversation dates/IDs from the export file or
   session store for the trailing window (30 days is a good default; use the
   full range after a first import).
2. **Enumerate the archive:** list `conversations/` pages in the brain repo
   for the same window (the date-prefixed slugs make this a filename scan).
3. **Diff.** Any source conversation with no corresponding page is a gap.
4. **Heal:** convert the missing conversations, re-import (Steps 4-6).
5. **Verify:** re-run the diff. A second pass reporting zero gaps is the done
   signal — one pass is not.

For ongoing session capture, schedule the archive + gap-heal via
[cron-scheduler](../cron-scheduler/SKILL.md) /
[minion-orchestrator](../minion-orchestrator/SKILL.md). Scheduling is a
routing convention the user sets up — nothing fires mechanically just because
this skill exists; say so when proposing it.

## Session Transcripts (agent harness)

The same pipeline archives the agent's own session logs: one page per session
(or per day) under `conversations/sessions/`, same frontmatter, same message
format, same three invariants. Filter before writing:

- Sub-agent sessions and cron-triggered runs
- System messages, heartbeats, bootstrap prompts
- Empty sessions

Related native surface: `gbrain transcripts recent --days 7` reads recent raw
transcripts from the dream-cycle corpus directories (local-only). That is a
read of the raw corpus, not the durable archive — this skill is what makes
session history permanent, searchable, and fact-extracted.

## Retrieval & Tracing

- **Find a conversation:**
  `gbrain search "<what you remember>" --limit 20` — then filter results to
  `conversations/` slugs (prefix per provider: `conversations/chatgpt/`, …).
- **Pull a thread:** `gbrain get conversations/chatgpt/2025-03-15-agent-memory`
- **"When did I first discuss X":**
  1. `gbrain query "X" --limit 50` and sort `conversations/` hits by the
     slug's date prefix.
  2. Probe earlier: `gbrain query "X" --until <earliest-date-found>` and
     repeat until no earlier hit survives.
  3. Retry with synonyms and adjacent phrasings before declaring an origin —
     the user's early vocabulary for an idea often differs from the current
     term.
  4. Read the earliest page to confirm it is a genuine first discussion, then
     answer with the date, a verbatim quote, and the slug.
- **Idea evolution timeline:** collect the dated hits, quote key moments
  verbatim, present oldest → newest with slugs as citations.
- **Context around a date:** `gbrain day 2025-03-15` shows what else happened
  that day; `gbrain recall --query "X"` checks the extracted-facts arm.

## Output Format

**Import receipt** (after any import or backfill run):

```markdown
## Conversation Archive Import — YYYY-MM-DD

- Source: chatgpt export (conversations.json, N threads)
- Pages written: N under conversations/chatgpt/ (YYYY-MM-DD → YYYY-MM-DD)
- Redacted: N secrets / M PII spans (pre-write scan)
- Parser validation: N/N scanned clean (pattern: bold-name-no-time)
- Facts extracted: N facts / N pages (cost $X.XX)
- Gaps healed: N (dates: ...)  |  Gap re-check: clean
```

**Tracing answer** (for "when did I first discuss X"):

```markdown
First discussed: YYYY-MM-DD — conversations/chatgpt/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>
> "<verbatim quote of the first mention>"

Evolution:
- YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line development> (conversations/...)
- YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line development> (conversations/...)
```

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Summarizing or paraphrasing transcripts on import — the page IS the
  transcript; exact words only
- ❌ Writing a transcript without the pre-write secret/PII scan — an exported
  prompt with a pasted `sk-…` key or `ghp_…` token becomes an indexed,
  searchable, leakable page (redaction is the one sanctioned edit)
- ❌ Overwriting a colliding slug (same-day "New chat") — suffix a short thread
  hash; `put_page` has no CAS, so a blind write silently loses the first thread
- ❌ Inventing a message line format the parser can't read — validate with
  `gbrain conversation-parser scan` before bulk-converting
- ❌ Hand-patching pages the parser rejects — fix the converter and
  regenerate (write-path discipline)
- ❌ "Yesterday only" archiving — every run diffs a trailing window and
  backfills (invariant 2)
- ❌ Archive cadence slower than source eviction — evicted content is
  unrecoverable (invariant 1)
- ❌ A wrapper that commits/imports a different directory than the converter
  writes (invariant 3)
- ❌ Declaring "you never discussed X" after one failed search — try
  synonyms, check `gbrain recall`, and only then answer in the negative
- ❌ Bulk-converting thousands of threads before validating a 3-5 page sample
- ❌ Filing conversations under `sources/` or as summary notes — the filing
  rule for imported chat exports is `conversations/`

## Dedup (sharp boundaries)

- **[chat-connectors](../chat-connectors/SKILL.md)** — the LIVE, account-connected
  lane: connect a ChatGPT/Claude account and sync new conversations
  automatically (cookie/OAuth, incremental watermark, scheduled). This skill owns
  the EXPORT-FILE lane (a downloaded `conversations.json`) and ALL retrieval/
  tracing. Route "connect my chatgpt / keep my conversations synced" there;
  route "I downloaded my export" / "when did I first discuss X" here. Perplexity
  (no live connector) uses this skill's manual conversion.
- **[voice-note-ingest](../voice-note-ingest/SKILL.md)** — audio. Voice
  memos and audio messages route there (transcription + exact-phrasing
  filing). This skill handles text chat exports and session logs.
- **[meeting-ingestion](../meeting-ingestion/SKILL.md)** — human meetings.
  Meeting transcripts file under `meetings/` with attendee enrichment and
  timeline merge. An AI-assistant thread is not a meeting.
- **[capture](../capture/SKILL.md)** — the single-item front door
  (`gbrain capture` → `inbox/`). One pasted snippet routes there; a corpus of
  conversations routes here.
- **[bulk-ingestion](../bulk-ingestion/SKILL.md)** — the generic large-corpus
  lifecycle (manifest, trial → bulk, resume). For a multi-thousand-thread
  export, use its manifest to track THIS skill's conversion procedure — the
  two compose rather than compete.
- **[concept-synthesis](../concept-synthesis/SKILL.md)** — "trace idea
  evolution" across the whole brain (concepts, notes, essays). This skill
  answers when/how an idea appeared within the conversation corpus
  specifically; hand findings to concept-synthesis for cross-corpus work.
- **[signal-detector](../signal-detector/SKILL.md)** — real-time per-message
  entity/signal capture during live conversation. The archive is the bulk
  persistence layer: it keeps EVERYTHING, not just detected signals.

## Contract

This skill guarantees:

- Imported conversations land as one page per conversation under
  `conversations/<provider>/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` with `type: conversation`,
  a `date:` frontmatter field, and a verbatim transcript in a
  parser-recognized message format.
- Every conversation is scanned for secret-shaped strings (by wire format,
  not just vendor prefix — JWTs, cloud/API key shapes, connection-string
  credentials, high-entropy assignments) and PII before its page is written;
  matches are redacted to labeled placeholders and counted in the import
  receipt (untrusted-content convention). A page that still captured a
  secret is removed immediately with `gbrain delete <slug> --purge`.
- Colliding slugs (untitled/same-day threads) are disambiguated with a short
  stable thread hash and check-before-write, never overwritten.
- Every import run validates a sample via `gbrain conversation-parser scan`
  before bulk conversion, and reports parser results in the import receipt.
- Fact extraction goes through the native `gbrain extract-conversation-facts`
  flow (cost-capped, resumable) — never a hand-rolled extractor.
- Every import or scheduled archive run performs the gap diff (source vs
  archive) over a trailing window and backfills the difference; completion is
  claimed only after a clean second pass.
- The three invariants hold in any archiver built from this skill: cadence
  outruns eviction, gaps are detected and healed, write-path equals
  commit-path.
- Tracing answers cite dated slugs and verbatim quotes; negative answers
  ("never discussed") come only after synonym retries and a facts-arm check.
- Output written under the directories listed in `writes_to:`.
- Privacy contract preserved: no real names in examples or reports, no
  fork-specific filesystem path literals, no upstream-fork references.

The full behavior contract is documented in the body sections above; this
section exists for the conformance test.
